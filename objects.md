## Objects


Iterate over this object and log all the properties in the console:
```javascript
const items = {
  'first': new Date(),
  'second': 2,
  'third': 'test',
  'fourth': 78.90,
  'fifth': null
}
```

Define a function checkProperty() that will use the following object passed as an argument. The function is expected to print as output in the console the object and its properties if the house is for sale. If not, a message must be printed telling the user that the property with this address is not for sale. You can make up the text to be printed yourself, but you need to use all the values in the property object.

```javascript
let property = {
  owner: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 44,
  },
  isForSale: true,
  sqrm: 120,
  address: {
    street: "Happy St",
    number: 123,
    city: "Miami",
    state: "FL",
    country: "US",
  },
  amenities: ["pool", "tennis court", "private parking", "yard"],
};
```
